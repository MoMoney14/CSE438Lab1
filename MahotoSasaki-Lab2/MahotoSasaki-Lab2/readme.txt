CREATIVE PORTION
1. What you implemented?
I implemented a feature that reduces the happiness and food level by 1 on the display bar every 5 seconds for the selected pet that the user is on. I implemented a feature where the animal speaks depending on its food level. If the happiness or the food level is 0, the animal says they are not getting enough happiness and/or food. If the happiness or food level is maxed out on the display bar, the animal says they are happy and/or full. I also implemented a vibration function when the animal has no food or no happiness.

2. How you implemented it?
I implemented a timer that has a counter every 5 seconds and checks if the food and happiness level are above 0. If they are, the function associated with the timer reduces the food or happiness level by one. I implemented the vibration importing AudioToolBox.

3. Why you implemented it?
I implemented this because I felt that it would be more engaging for the user if they have to constantly pay attention to the animal's food and happiness level. The addition of the feature allows user to enjoy a game-like experience where they feel as if they are raising an actual pet because they need constant attention.
